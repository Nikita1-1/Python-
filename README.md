<h4> My Blue Bird Banking Project</h4> is the most challenging one. The application for keeping track of various bank accounts.
  <h4> Challenges: </h4>
  <h5> 1. Create an account to be tracked that obtains the following information from the user
       2. The user must then be able to add transactions to the account, including the following information
       3. The application must allow the user to see their current bank account balance and all transactions that apply to it
       4. The user should be able to select from the main page to view an account - with a drop down form made up of names, or create a new account
       5. Apply static files
     </h5>
